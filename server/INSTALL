I haven't written any finished package for blendserv, but included is a 
systemd service script (blendsev.service). It looks for blendserv.py in
/usr/bin/ although this can easily be changed. Read the file itself for
usage.

Essentially though,

cp server/blendserv.py /usr/bin/
cp server/blendser.service /usr/lib/systemd/system
systemctl enable blendserv
systemctl start blendserv
